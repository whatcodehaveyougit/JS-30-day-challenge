# Custom Video player


# Query Selector

QuerySelector supports calling classes / Instead of document.getElementsByClassName('example')
Example:  const player = document.querySelector('.player')

It can also dig into divs, as long as the class is there then it will find it.

# The Video built in methods

On this lesson I learned a lot of the built in methods to the JS video object (ie paused, currentTime, play, pause)

# textContent

I have never actually used textContent before, always innerHtml.  So it was good to learn a new way, this seems more elegant too.

toggle.textContent = icon

In this instance we called the class 'toggle' and changed the inner textContent to the icon.
