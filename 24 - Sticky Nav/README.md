# Sticky Nav

Some really nice elegant pieces of code today, esp the css which was made simple by smart combining of CSS and JS.

### Animations

In order to get an animation to work with a transition you must use max-width not width
The example of where the logo slides in demonstrates this.


This was also a great bit of CSS - only happens when the fixed nav is generated with JS addClassList

.fixed-nav .site-wrap {
  transform: scale(1)
}

### offsetTop

The distance from the top of the navigation bar to top of the page.  

Used this to calculated when to activate the function.
