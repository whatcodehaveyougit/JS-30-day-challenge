### Day 1 JS Drum Kit

This exercise acquainted me more with the different events which can be triggered from an event listener.  There are loads!
Then once the event has happened you know which event it is by console logging it to the browser.  This can be seen on the removeClass function.

The querySelectorAll function brings back a NodeList which is like an array but not an array, it has far less functions.
However, the forEach works so that is quite useful.

The <audio> HTML element has loads of JS methods which can be used on it.  As can be seen by this link

So we used them and that was interesting!

Was also funny having the 'data-key' attribute on a div, never seen that before.  
It seems like this is a feature which allows one to store and 'data' the developer would like on a HTML element.
This stack overflow post suggested that, another thing I learned!
