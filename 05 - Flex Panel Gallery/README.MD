### DAY 5

.includes - A useful little JS function to see whether something which is return includes '...'

classList.toggle < Toggle is very useful, saves you writing out it twice.  Can be used on events like 'click' as users know to click something both to bring it up and put it away.

Nesting flexbox containers within flexbox containers, nice example of it being done.

The transform CSS property basically absolutely positions the element somewhere else relative to its actual position. THis means it can be brought in to the users viewport by adding adding a class to make it at its normal position.
transform: translateY(-100%);
