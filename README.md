# My JS 30 Project

Each day includes:

- My Code!
- Comments to explain my logic.
- A README to discuss the challenges I faced, my solutions and what I learned :)

Please note that I am following tutorials here so not all the code in these files is my own although I am writing it all.  Code which is my own will stand out with comments of mine.
