# Geolocation

Cool tutorial on how to setup localhost to work on the iPhone which I did !

Had some problems enabling location services to work on the iPhone but was sorted in the end.

Quite a short tutorial, just getting us to access location data via

navigator.geolocation.watchPosition((data)

Then from data we accessed the information inside it to display the speed and direction.
